String Search Lab

Execution:
    Simple run once
    $ go run ./strSearch.go

    Test different chunk sizes by adding any command line argument(s)
    $ go run ./strSearch.go only checks command line length greater than 1

The testing option will check numerous chunk sizes and checks which chunk size (amount of lines to process per goroutine) 
has the best speed increase from the sequential code.
On my machine, I wasn't seeing a consistent one chunk size that was better than the rest, so I set the default to 20 line chunks.
