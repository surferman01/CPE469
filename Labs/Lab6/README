# Lab 6 Instructions

## Running the Server

To start the server, navigate to the `server` directory and run the following command:

`go run server.go`

## Initializing Nodes

Adjust MAX_NODES in shared to choose the cluster size. (default 5)

`go run client.go [id]`

## Sending Requests (get/put)

Start the messanger.go file and send requests in the following format:

[reqType] [key] [value]

ex) put Anna 100

ex) get Anna .

You need to have 3 args for each request (even get), but the third argument of the get request does nothing.

`go run messenger.go`
